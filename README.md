## Project Description
Simple  app  allowing user to see mentors and employees list, authenticate , create group of employees, share profile with other employees.
## Technologies that I choose for development 
###  Routing
* [Native Stack Navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/) The @react-navigation/native-stack library enables you to use native navigation components on Android and iOS instead of relying on the JavaScript API, allowing for smoother animation and improved performance.
 ###  State Managment
* [Redux/Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) Redux Toolkit is a set of tools and utilities that enable developers to easily write sophisticated Redux applications. It provides a powerful API for creating reducers, selectors, and action creators, as well as utilities for testing, debugging, and structuring your code. It also has advanced features such as immutable updates, optimistic updates, and memoization.
 
 ###  UI Framework
* [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/)  It provides a comprehensive set of components that are easy to use. It has a large community of contributors and can be customized with additional components from the Elements library.
But sometimes there is no need to use any UI framework,just becouse built in components are enough to build user interface.
